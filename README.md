# AndroidConcepts

My personal learning topic-wise project with inDepth concepts and comments/learning summary.

### Topics covered [see package structure/prs/branches if not found] : 

  1. File Downloader [low level design + advanced concurrency]
  2. Producer Consumer [concurrency]
  3. Cancellations in Coroutines and RxJava [proper reasoning of why coroutines is hard]
  4. General Observables
  5. Background thread executors [replacement for simple background work]
  6. Coroutines [benefits + how even coroutines can block and not suspend]
  7. Java concurrency in practice learnings [advanced concurrency, not for kids]
  8. Livedata [benefits]
  9. How to create your own livedata better than google's livedata
  10. Retro UI [like cred]
  11. Manually handling config changes and not let the activity destroy
  12. Java complete reference : data structure operations with measured time [relevant for android developers]
  13. Spamming threads : starting 100s of threads and busting myth that threads are heavy
  14. Creating own RxJava like framework
  15. Problems with fragment and its navigation
